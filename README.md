# FiveM-Soundpack-Swapper

## Usage

1. **Set Up Soundpack Folders**:
   - Create folders (e.g., `Sinners`, `Bell`, `Default`) in the same directory as the batch file.
   - Place your `RESIDENT.rpf` and `WEAPONS_PLAYER.rpf` files in each folder.

2. **Run the Batch File**:
   - Double-click to launch, and choose the soundpack by entering its number when prompted.

3. **Copy Files**:
   - The script checks for the necessary files and, if found, copies them to your GTA V directory.

4. **Finish**:
   - You’ll receive a confirmation message; press any key to exit.

## Important

- **Target Path**: Update `TARGET_PATH` in the batch file if GTA V is installed in a different location:

  ```
  C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Grand Theft Auto V\x64\audio\sfx
  ```
